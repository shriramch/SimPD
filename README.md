This repository contains the code and results for an agent-based model (ABM) exploring the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD) with networked players.
### File Structure
- ```ipd.ipynb```: This Jupyter Notebook file contains the code for the agent-based model, detailing the implementation of the IPD with strategies, strategy-switching mechanisms, and networks, and a simulator class to run a simulation based on parameters.
- ```results``` folder: This folder contains the results of five experiments as found in the source code.
